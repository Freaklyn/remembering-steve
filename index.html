          <h4> Steve Jobs</h4>
          <p>What impact has Steve Jobs had on my life? Every short story I've written as an adult (and certainly every one that has been published), almost every email I've written, has been written on machines created by Apple. I interacted online using an Apple machine long before i ever encounterd a PC. Steve Jobs helped to realize the Star Trek future I dreamed of as kid And through his vision, I have been able to realize my own. You'll be missed , Mr Jobs. Thanks for all your amazing work. </p>

          <p>A part of my heart has cracked. I didn't know him personally but i felt like i knew him. I will forever remember him. I'm still saddened because he was taken too soon. I can only imagine his struggles. Heaven has certainly gained an angel</p>
